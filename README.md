Stuff and things

Backtesting done in COMPILED python, actual trading can be done in intrepreted python.

Threading for backtesting will have to happen above the python. My thinking is that we run our compiled python files in C++, or we literally just fork from python or bash or something easy.

We are starting with JUST momentum trading, no machine learning of any sort.
