'''IDEAS
        -Make verbose option that prints out whenever a purchase is made, or better yet, prints to a file
        -Make functions that show stuff like return or growth over time or something idk
        -Make __str__ that prints the holdings dictionary pretty
        
        -Eventually will need to track how many trades each ticker has and how long we held each ticker so that we can incorporate management/holding and trading fees
